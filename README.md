# Hyperparameter tuning on the raisins dataset.

This project is a continuation of a CodeCademy project. Everything seen here is my own work, I only took inspiration from the previously mentioned guided project. 

The dataset has been posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/raisin-dataset) by [Murat Koklu](https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/), a researcher who has studied different raisin grain types using machine learning methods.

There are two raisin grain types in this dataset, Kecimen and Besni and seven numerical predictor variables associated with each of the 900 samples in the data.
